# fetchjson

This project (`fetchjson`) was created as part of the Udemy course "Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide" by Stephen Grider.

The primary goal of this project is to practice:
- Setting up a TypeScript project.
- Using `axios` to fetch JSON data from an API.
- Defining interfaces in TypeScript to describe the structure of the fetched data.
- Writing and compiling TypeScript code.

## Project Structure (example)
- `index.ts`: Main TypeScript file for fetching and logging data.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler options.

Feel free to explore the code and see these concepts in action.
